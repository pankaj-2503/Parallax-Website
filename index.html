        <h2>Section One</h2>
        <p>The natural environment or natural world encompasses all living and non-living things occurring naturally,
            meaning in this case not artificial. The term is most often applied to the Earth or some parts of Earth.
            This environment encompasses the interaction of all living species, climate, weather and natural resources
            that affect human survival and economic activity. The concept of the natural environment can be
            distinguished as components:

            Complete ecological units that function as natural systems without massive civilized human intervention,
            including all vegetation, microorganisms, soil, rocks, atmosphere, and natural phenomena that occur within
            their boundaries and their nature.
            Universal natural resources and physical phenomena that lack clear-cut boundaries, such as air, water, and
            climate, as well as energy, radiation, electric charge, and magnetism, not originating from civilized human
            actions.</p>

        <h2>Section Two</h2>
        <p>In contrast to the natural environment is the built environment. Built environments are where humans have
            fundamentally transformed landscapes such as urban settings and agricultural land conversion, the natural
            environment is greatly changed into a simplified human environment. Even acts which seem less extreme, such
            as building a mud hut or a photovoltaic system in the desert, the modified environment becomes an artificial
            one. Though many animals build things to provide a better environment for themselves, they are not human,
            hence beaver dams, and the works of mound-building termites, are thought of as natural.

            People cannot find absolutely natural environments on Earth, and naturalness usually varies in a continuum,
            from 100% natural in one extreme to 0% natural in the other. The massive environmental changes of humanity
            in the Anthropocene have fundamentally effected all natural environments: including from climate change,
            biodiversity loss and pollution from plastic and other chemicals in the air and water. More precisely, we
            can consider the different aspects or components of an environment, and see that their degree of naturalness
            is not uniform.[2] If, for instance, in an agricultural field, the mineralogic composition and the structure
            of its soil are similar to those of an undisturbed forest soil, but the structure is quite different</p>

        <h2>Section Three</h2>
        <p>Earth science generally recognizes four spheres, the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere, and the
            biosphere as correspondent to rocks, water, air, and life respectively. Some scientists include as part
            of the spheres of the Earth, the cryosphere (corresponding to ice) as a distinct portion of the hydrosphere,
            as well as the pedosphere (to soil) as an active and intermixed sphere. Earth science (also known as
            geoscience, the geographical sciences or the Earth Sciences), is an all-embracing term for the sciences
            related to the planet Earth.There are four major disciplines in earth sciences, namely geography,
            geology, geophysics and geodesy. These major disciplines use physics, chemistry, biology, chronology and
            mathematics to build a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the principal areas or spheres of
            Earth.</p>
